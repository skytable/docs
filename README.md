### Making changes to the `docs/Actions` folder
The `Actions` folder contains the documentation for the actions that Skytable supports. However, by no means should you modify them _here_.
You should instead update [this file](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/blob/next/actiondoc.yml). The documentation for the actions or the _actiondoc_ as we call it is built automatically from this file by using the `docbuilder` (our custom tool for generating documentation).
