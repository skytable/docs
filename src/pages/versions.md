# All versions

A maintained version is one that actively receives security, performance and feature updates. Please see the
[versioning policy](https://github.com/skytable/rfcs/blob/next/rfcs/rfc-1.md) to know which versions are maintained.
As we follow a "ship early, ship often" release cycle, combined with Semver â€” a _specific version_ isn't
maintained. Instead, the last major version as defined by the versioning policy is maintained.

## Active versions

The following major versions are actively maintained:

- Version 0.8 (currently under development)
- Version 0.7
