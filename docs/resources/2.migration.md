title: Migrating from an older release
---

Firstly, thank you patron! You're a part of an exclusive *club* which has seen Skytable take shape from *just another key-value* 
store into a powerful database and we couldn't be more honored to be a choice in your stack. This document is meant for people 
coming from version prior to Skytable Octave (0.8).

Let's get you up to speed with the new semantics:

- **Keyspaces are now spaces**
- **Tables are now models** and can store multiple fields
- **Nested lists are now supported**
- **All the actions are gone!**
- **There is no `default:default` keyspace and model**: You will need to create your own `space` and `model`

## From actions to BlueQL

- `SET x y` becomes: `INSERT INTO mymodel(x, ?)`
- `GET x` becomes `SELECT * FROM mymodel WHERE <primary_key> = x`
- `UPDATE x y` becomes `UPDATE mymodel SET field_name = ? WHERE <primary_key> = x`
- `DEL X` becomes `DELETE FROM mymodel WHERE <primary_key> = x`

Essentially, you no longer have the key/value semantics but a more SQL-like interface for querying with BlueQL. You can continue
to use lists (create, update) but individual element access is currently limited. See [this page for more information](/limits).
