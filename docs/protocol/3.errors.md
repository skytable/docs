title: Errors

If you've done something incorrectly, then the server will respond with an error code (just like HTTP status codes, but note that the server will not respond with an error code if no error occurred, unlike HTTP 200!).

## Handshake errors

These errors occur **before the connection is sucessfully established**.

| Code | Meaning                        | Likely explanation                                                                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Illegal packet                 | Client library bug because it sent an incorrect handshake packet to the server                                      |
| 1    | Incompatible handshake version | Server does not support handshake version used by client                                                            |
| 2    | Incompatible protocol version  | Server does not support protocol version used by client                                                             |
| 3    | Incompatible exchange mode     | Server does not support the chosen data exchange mode                                                               |
| 4    | Incompatible query mode        | Server does not support the chosen query mode                                                                       |
| 5    | Invalid authentication data    | Either an incorrect username or password (or both) or the client library generated an illegal authentication header |

## Query errors

These errors can occur **when running a query**.
