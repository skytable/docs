## Community and chat

The community platform that we use the most is Discord. Here is a link to [our Discord Community](https://discord.gg/QptWFdx). 
Both our developers and users hang out almost all day around here, so you can expect to get your query resolved fairly quickly.

## News

- [**Skytable Blog**](https://blog.skytable.io): This is where you'll hear from us about major updates such as new releases, changes in maintenance and such
- [**X/Twitter**](https://twitter.com/skytabledb): On X (formerly Twitter), we post live updates as we work on new features. If there's a quick update or milestone, you'll be the first to know here
- [**E-mail**](https://cdn.forms-content.sg-form.com/e4a9719e-d94e-11eb-89d2-9232e6ded8b5): While we haven't ever sent out any e-mails, if you're keen on signing up for updates in the (near) future, it's a good idea to subscribe to this list. Just like we said, we haven't yet sent out anything! We're building software, not sending you fancy email!

## Examples

- [**Jotsy (rust)**](https://github.com/ohsayan/jotsy): Jotsy is a very small "blog" implementation that is written in Rust with Skytable and the Axum framework. If you're building something in Rust, do check it out
- [**Client repo (rust)**](https://github.com/skytable/client-rust): While this is in Rust, you might find the examples useful regardless of which language you're developing your application in
