title: Benchmarking
---

Due to Skytable having in-house implementations of almost everything, starting from the protocol, the storage engine and query 
language â€” we have our own custom load testing tool called `sky-bench` that is distributed with the bundle.

## Setting up for benchmarking

**Quick notes**:
- The benchmark tool will create:
  - a space called `bench`
  - a model called `bench`
- **Be sure that these objects don't already exist!** But don't worry, if they do â€” the benchmark tool will error. You won't lose any data
- **Once the benchmark is complete, the `bench` space is removed!**
- **Do not use the `bench` space during the benchmark**: You might lose data

**The benchmark tool will:**
- Run a total of 4,000,000 queries (don't worry, they run pretty fast!):
  - Run 1,000,000 `INSERT`s
  - Run 1,000,000 `SELECT`s
  - Run 1,000,000 `UPDATE`s
  - Run 1,000,000 `DELETE`s
- The model used has the declaration `(un: string, pw: uint8)`
- The `SELECT` will select and return all fields
- The `UPDATE` will increment the value of `pw` like this `pw += 1`
- The `DELETE` removes the entire collection
- The default primary key size is 7 bytes. All generated keys will be padded with zeros from to 0 to 999,999 like this: `0000000` or `0999999`

## Off to the races

1. Start up the database server
2. Run `./sky-bench --password <your root password>`. We need your `root` password because only the root account can create, alter and drop models and the benchmark tool needs to run these queries
3. Wait for it to happen. You may not believe your eyes, so we recommend that you keep your eyes hydrated ðŸ”¥ðŸš€âœ¨ðŸ’£
