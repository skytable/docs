DDL or _Data Definition Language_ is a way to interact with [containers](containers). Skytable lets you interact with containers with the following DDL actions:

- [`CREATE`](#create) to create containers
- [`USE`](#use) to switch to containers and run actions in them
- [`INSPECT`](#inspect) to inspect containers
- [`DROP`](#drop) to delete containers

## CREATE

### Keyspaces

- **Time complexity**: O(1)
- **Transactional**: Not yet
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  CREATE KEYSPACE <name>
  ```
- **Returns**:
  - Okay if the keyspace was created
  - `err-already-exists` if it already existed
  - server error if something unpredictable has happened on the server side

### Tables

- **Time complexity**: O(1)
- **Transactional**: Not yet
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE <entity> <model>(modelargs) <properties>
  ```
- **Returns**:
  - Okay if the table was created
  - `err-already-exists` if it already existed
  - `default-container-unset` if the connection level default keyspace has not been set
  - server error if something unpredictable has happened on the server side

## DROP

### Keyspaces

- **Time complexity**: O(1)
- **Transactional**: Not yet
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  DROP KEYSPACE <name>
  ```
- **Returns**:
  - Okay if the keyspace was deleted
  - `container-not-found` if the keyspace wasn't found
  - `still-in-use` if clients are still connected to the keyspace or the keyspace is not empty
  - server error if something unpredictable has happened on the server side

### Tables

- **Time complexity**: O(1)
- **Transactional**: Not yet
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE <entity>
  ```
- **Returns**:
  - Okay if the table was deleted
  - `container-not-found` if the keyspace wasn't found
  - `still-in-use` if clients are still connected to the table
  - `default-container-unset` if the connection level default keyspace has not been set
  - server error if something unpredictable has happened on the server side

## INSPECT

### Entire database

To inspect the entire database, run:

```sql
INSPECT KEYSPACES
```

This will return a flat array with all the keyspace names

### Keyspaces

To inspect a keyspace, run:

```sql
INSPECT KEYSPACE <name>
```

This will return a flat array with all the table names

### Tables

To inspect a table, run:

```sql
INSPECT TABLE <entity>
```

This will return a string with the table's _syntactical description_. For example, the keymap model
_can_ return:

```js
Keymap { data: (binstr,binstr), volatile: true }
```

## USE

### Keyspaces

- **Time complexity**: O(1)
- **Transactional**: Not applicable
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  USE <keyspace_name>
  ```
- **Returns**:
  - Okay if the keyspace was switched
  - `container-not-found` if the keyspace wasn't found

### Tables

- **Time complexity**: O(1)
- **Transactional**: Not applicable
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  USE <entity>
  ```
- **Returns**:
  - Okay if the table was switched
  - `container-not-found` if the keyspace wasn't found
  - `default-container-unset` if the connection level default keyspace has not been set
