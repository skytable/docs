title: Configuration

Skytable can be configured to run per your needs. You can use either of command-line arguments, environment variables or a 
configuration file. We don't have any specific recommendation for a mode of configuration but we generally consider using a
configuration file to be the best practice since it is something that won't get lost (which in other cases can get lost due
to lost shell history and such).

## Configuration file

The configuration file is a simple YAML file. Use this as your configuration file template:

```yaml
system:
  mode: prod
  rs_window: 300

auth:
  plugin: pwd
  # replace with your root password of choice
  root_pass: password

endpoints:
  secure:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 2004
    # replace `cert` with the path to your self-signed certificate
    cert: cert.pem
    # replace `private_key` with the path to your private key
    private_key: private.key
    # replace `passphrase.txt` with the path to your private key passphrase
    pkey_passphrase: passphrase.txt
  insecure:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 2003
```

To start the server with a configuration file, simply run `skyd --config <path to config>.yaml`

Here's an explanation of all the keys:
- `system`:
  - `mode`: set to either `dev` / `prod` mode. `prod` mode will generally make some things stricters (such as background services)
  - `rs_window`: **This is a very important setting!** It is set to `300` by default and is called the "reliability service window" which ensures that if any changes are observed in `300` (or whatever value you set) seconds, then they reach the disk
  as soon as that time elapses. For example, in the default configuration the system checks for changes every 5 minutes and if there are any dataset changes, they are immediately synced
- `auth`:
  - `plugin`: this is the authentication plugin. we currently only have `pwd` that is a simple password based authentication system where the password is stored as an [`rcrypt` hash](https://github.com/ohsayan/rcrypt) on disk. More `plugin` options are set to be implemented for more advanced authentication, especially in enterprise settings
  - `root_pass`: this is the root account password. **It must have atleast 16 characters**
- `endpoints`:
  - `secure`:
    - `host`: the host for your secure (TLS) endpoint
    - `port`: the port for your secure (TLS) endpoint
    - `cert`: path to the PEM certificate to use for TLS
    - `private_key`: path to the PEM private key to use for TLS
    - `pkey_passphrase`: all private keys must be secured with a passphrase; this key should be set to **the path of a plaintext file containing your passphrase** and **not the passphrase itself**
  - `insecure`:
    - `host`: the host for your TCP endpoint
    - `port`: the port for your TCP endpoint
