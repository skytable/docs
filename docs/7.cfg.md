title: Configuration basics
---

Skytable can be configured to a great degree, depending on your requirements. You can configure Skytable using:

- [Configuration files](config-files): A simple TOML file to tune your settings
- [Command-line arguments](config-cmd): Use command-line parameters to configure the database
- [Environment variables](config-env): Use environment variables for configuration

## Deployment mode

Skytable uses the idea of a `dev` and `prod` mode to make configuration during deployment easier. The `dev`/`prod`
mode setting can be changed by using your preferred mode of configuration, as listed above.

### `dev` mode

The `dev` mode allows you to use any configuration without any hard checks. This is suitable for use
during development

### `prod` mode

In this mode, you are required to use the settings that we recommend for production usage. This includes
strict requirements on BGSAVE, TLS and snapshot settings. Here's what's required for production:

| Setting             | Requirement                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Maximum connections | Must be lesser than or equal to the resource limits set for that process (on Unix)                                                         |
| Terminal artwork    | Disabled                                                                                                                                   |
| BGSAVE              | Enabled                                                                                                                                    |
| Snapshot failsafe   | Set to `true                                                                                                                               |
| TLS                 | Atleast insecure TCP+TLS multi-socket mode or TLS-only mode must be enabled. If authn/authz is enabled, then TLS-only mode must be enabled |
