## Recommendations

Here are some _good to know_ things about deploying Skytable:

- Skytable is under active development. If you do find any rough edges, [please open an issue](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/issues)
- The daemon will create a `.sky_pid` file in its working directory which functions as a PID file
  and indicates other processes to not use the data directory. If the daemon is somehow forcefully
  stopped, the file may not be removed. In that case, you should manually remove the file
- Skytable currently has a default limit of 50000 connections on a single daemon instance. This limit
  can be modified [in your configuration](config).
  :::note
  Make sure you change the maximum number of connections according to the available system resources to avoid DoS
  like attacks that may cause your system to crash
  :::
- Skytable is inherently multithreaded. As of now, there is no way to stop Skytable from using
  multiple threads
- The best way to deploy Skytable is as a service (and disabling terminal artwork)

## System requirements

### Hardware

- For Intel x86/x86_64 based systems, virtually all processors deployed today will run Skytable without any
  trouble. On a more specific note, Intel processors released after 2001 and AMD based processors released
  after 2003 are compatible
- For ARM64 based systems, there are no additional requirements

:::tip Fun fact
To sum up, if your processor is from this century, it will most likely work fine ;)

### Software

No special requirements as of now.
