title: Command-line configuration
---

You can use command line arguments alone for configuration in place of configuration files. Every binary ( `skyd` , `skysh` and `sky-bench` ) that you get with a bundle have extremely helpful help menus. Whatever you can configure with the configuration file can be configured through command line
arguments.

- `skyd --help` : Brings up the help menu for `skyd`
- `skysh --help` : Brings up the help menu for `skysh`
- `sky-bench --help` : Brings up the help menu for `sky-bench`

:::tip
There is no specific _advantage_ in using command-line arguments over configuration files or
vice versa. When any kind of configuration is specified: either a configuration file or command
line arguments, it is parsed once at startup and then the same configuration is used throughout.
It is really a matter of choice (or convenience).

:::caution
You must specify either a configuration file **or** command-line arguments. If you provide both &mdash;
the database will shut down with an error that asks you to provide either one mode of configuration
