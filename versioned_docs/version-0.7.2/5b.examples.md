## DDL

1.  Create a keymap table called 'cats' in a keyspace 'animals'. The cat's name will be the key
    which as an `str` value while the value would be the cat's image in a binary format, so it'll be
    of the `binstr` type.

    a. Let's create the keyspace

    ```sql
    CREATE KEYSPACE animals
    ```

    b. Let's create the table:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE animals:cat keymap(str,binstr)
    ```

    c. Let's switch to the table:

    ```sql
    USE animals:cat
    ```

    d. Let's inspect it:

    ```sql
    INSPECT TABLE animals:cat
    ```

    e. Let's drop the table:

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE animals:cat
    ```

    f. Let's drop the keyspace

    ```sql
    DROP KEYSPACE animals
    ```

2.  Create a keymap table called 'favorites' in the 'default' keyspace. This will store a favorite
    name, an `str` and an URL, also an `str`:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE favorites keymap(str,str)
    ```

3.  Create a keymap table called 'cache' in the 'default' keyspace that is volatile. Our cache key is an `str` while the value would be some binary data, so `binstr`:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE cache keymap(str,binstr) volatile
    ```

## Lists

1. Create a table called 'notes' in the default keyspace. We'll have usernames linked to a collection
   of notes made by them. Since the names are unicode values, we'll use the `str` type for the key.
   For the data type, we'll use the `list` type, with the inner type as `str` since the notes will also
   have unicode characters (like emojis, for example). If we needed to store binary data within the
   lists, we'd simply use the `binstr` data type instead.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE notes keymap(str,list<str>)
   ```

2. Now let's switch to the table

   ```sql
   use default:notes
   ```

3. Let's add some notes made by our theoretical user `joe`. This is how it goes (`#` signs were simply
   added for explanations, simply ignore them):

   ```sql
   # create an empty list
   LSET sayan
   # now append some notes
   LMOD sayan PUSH "Just woke up. Jotting down today's first note!"
   LMOD sayan PUSH "Heading to the subway; gotta get to work fast!"
   LMOD sayan PUSH "Funny that someone broke my chair! Just called someone to get it fixed!"
   LMOD sayan PUSH "Brrr...on my work machine. See you later!"
   LMOD sayan PUSH "Done with work, now heading home!"
   LMOD sayan PUSH "Woot, I'm home. What a hectic day!"
   ```

4. Let's read all the notes:

   ```sql
   LGET sayan
   ```

   This would have printed out all the notes if we were using the command-line client, like this:

   ```sql
   (1) "Just woke up. Jotting down today's first note!"
   (2) "Heading to the subway; gotta get to work fast!"
   (3) "Funny that someone broke my chair! Just called someone to get it fixed!"
   (4) "Brrr...on my work machine. See you later!"
   (5) "Done with work, now heading home!"
   (6) "Woot, I'm home. What a hectic day!"
   ```

5. Let's read a maximum of 5 notes:

   ```sql
   LGET sayan LIMIT 5
   ```

   This would output:

   ```sql
   (1) "Just woke up. Jotting down today's first note!"
   (2) "Heading to the subway; gotta get to work fast!"
   (3) "Funny that someone broke my chair! Just called someone to get it fixed!"
   (4) "Brrr...on my work machine. See you later!"
   (5) "Done with work, now heading home!"
   ```

6. Now let's remove the "broken chair" note because it turns out that I actually had the wrong chair!

   ```sql
   LMOD sayan REMOVE 2
   ```

   > Remember that array indexes start at 0? Duh!

   Let's see what we have with `LGET sayan`:

   ```sql
   (1) "Just woke up. Jotting down today's first note!"
   (2) "Heading to the subway; gotta get to work fast!"
   (3) "Brrr...on my work machine. See you later!"
   (4) "Done with work, now heading home!"
   (5) "Woot, I'm home. What a hectic day!"
   ```

7. Wait, I forgot about something! Someone left a mysterious letter on my desk. I discovered it as soon
   as I entered my workplace. Let's insert that:

   ```sql
   LMOD sayan INSERT 2 "Just discovered a mysterious letter on my desk! How cool!"
   ```

8. Let's get our entire bunch of notes now:

   ```sql
   LGET sayan
   ```

   This would output:

   ```sql
   (1) "Just woke up. Jotting down today's first note!"
   (2) "Heading to the subway; gotta get to work fast!"
   (3) "Just discovered a mysterious letter on my desk! How cool!"
   (4) "Brrr...on my work machine. See you later!"
   (5) "Done with work, now heading home!"
   (6) "Woot, I'm home. What a hectic day!"
   ```
