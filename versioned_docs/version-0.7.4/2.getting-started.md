Getting started with Skytable is easy ðŸ˜Š (and fun!). You can get started with [native binaries (recommended)](#get-started-with-bundles) or by using the [docker image](#get-started-with-docker).

## Get started with bundles

### Step 1: Download a bundle

Head over to this [page](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/releases/v0.7.4) and download a version for your platform.

:::tip Tip
If you're on Debian, consider downloading an appropriate `.deb` (Debian Package) file for your machine.
The package will install `skyd`, `skysh`, `sky-bench` and `sky-migrate` on your system while also
configuring a `systemd` service unit.
:::

### Step 2: Make the files runnable

Unzip the `zip` file that you just downloaded. If you're on a \*nix system, run `chmod +x skyd skysh` to make the files executable. If you're on Windows, right-click the files and then check the `UNBLOCK` checkbox and click on the `APPLY` button.

### Step 3: Start the database server

In the directory where you extracted the files, run `./skyd` on \*nix systems or simply `skyd` on Windows systems. That's all there is to starting the database server!

### Step 4: Run the shell `skysh`

`skysh` is the shell that is shipped with the bundle. Run it, just like you did with the database server. Now enter commands in the shell, and have fun! First run `HEYA` to check if everything is fine - the server should reply with _HEY!_.

You're done with setting up `skyd` ðŸŽ‰!

## Get started with Docker

First of all, you need to have Docker installed and available on your `PATH` ; you can read the official guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Once you've got Docker up and running, follow the steps!

:::note
You may need superuser privileges for installation and running the commands below

### Step 0: Create and start the container

We'll create a container where:

1. We'll call our container `mysky`
2. We'll expose port 2003 of the container
3. We'll save all our data on the host in a folder called `skytable` relative to the current directory. To achieve this, we'll make use of Docker volumes.

Open up a terminal and run:

```sh
docker run --name mysky \
    -v ./skytable:/var/lib/skytable \
    -p 2003:2003 \
    skytable/sdb:v0.7.4
```

### Step 1: Download and setup the bundle

Follow the [instructions above](#get-started-with-bundles) so that you're ready to run `skysh`

### Step 2: Connect to the instance

Simply run:

```sh
skysh -h 127.0.0.1 -p 2003
```

Now, you're all set!
