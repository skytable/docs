We have put in our best efforts to make Skytable really fast &mdash; but usage patterns can greatly
affect how well Skytable performs for you, and how well you are able to exploit the _on metal_
performance that Skytable can provide. Here are some quick pointers to get maximum performance:

- **Try to have a lesser number of tables**

  The number of tables you can create is virtually
  unlimited, but however, creating a huge number of tables (say over 60,000) _can_ hurt performance.

- **Try to use default connection level containers**

  Although you are free to run actions by
  specifying the table to use, it has a runtime cost because the table has to be looked up and errors
  need to be handled. Instead, try using default containers wherever possible. For example, if you
  have a table `cakes` in a keyspace `birthday` and your application will be using this table for
  the most part, it's a good idea to run `use birthday:cakes` after connecting and then using the
  actions without specifying a table (or keyspace). This avoids the lookup and error handling cost.

- If you know your data in keymap tables has valid unicode, try using the `binstr` type instead.
  This is because unicode validation adds a _very small_ runtime cost
