Welcome to Skytable's docs! You will find information about how you can get started with Skytable, installation options, configuration and clients.

## Users

We have an easy-to-follow guide for [Getting Started](getting-started). Once you've got everything up and running, you can take a look at the available actions [here](all-actions) and [configuration](config).
Once you've learned the basics, start using a [client driver](clients)!

## Developers

You can find information on how to build your own clients [here](protocol/skyhash). The primary idea is to implement the Skyhash Protocol.
