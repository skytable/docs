Getting started with Skytable is easy ðŸ˜Š (and fun!). You can get started with [native binaries (recommended)](#get-started-with-bundles) or by using the [docker image](#get-started-with-docker).

## Get started with bundles

### Step 1: Download a bundle

Head over to this [page](https://dl.skytable.io/security/v0.6.4) and download a version for your platform.

### Step 2: Make the files runnable

Unzip the `zip` file that you just downloaded. If you're on a \*nix system, run `chmod +x skyd skysh` to make the files executable. If you're on Windows, right-click the files and then check the `UNBLOCK` checkbox and click on the `APPLY` button.

### Step 3: Start the database server

In the directory where you extracted the files, run `./skyd` on \*nix systems or simply `skyd` on Windows systems. That's all there is to starting the database server!

### Step 4: Run the shell `skysh`

`skysh` is the shell that is shipped with the bundle. Run it, just like you did with the database server. Now enter commands in the shell, and have fun! First run `HEYA` to check if everything is fine - the server should reply with _HEY!_.
See all the available actions [here](actions-overview).

You're done with setting up `skyd` ðŸŽ‰!
